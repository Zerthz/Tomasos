# Tomasos

My final project for my ASP.NET #1 course for the .NET Developer program at Nackademin. 

The task was to produce a website from where you could display and order meals from a pizzeria. The application had to be hooked up to a MSSQL database containing all the dishes.

## Tech Used
* ASP.NET 
  * ASP.NET Identity for usermanagement
* .NET 6
* MVC
* MSSQL for database
  * Entity Framework Core for connetion to application
* CSS
* Very basic vanilla JavaScript
* Design patterns including 
  * Dependency Injection
  * Repository Pattern
  
## Learnings
Creating this project I learnt a lot about working with a larger project. Staying organized with so many pages and classes and files was a struggle that I had to overcome. 
In the end I must say that I'm happy with the way it came out. I learnt a great big deal about using ViewComponents and creating and trying to maintain thin controllers.
